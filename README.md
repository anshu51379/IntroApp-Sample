# IntroApp-Sample
Basic Introduction App created using Flutter!

I created a basic app which includes my photo, name and contact details i.e phone number and email address. I used CircleAvatar widget to display my photo, Text widget to display my name, one Card widget to show phone number and another card widget to show email address. I used the Pacifico font for the name, which is available at Google Fonts. Please have a look at the main.dart file (lib folder) to view my code and the snapshot attached here!
